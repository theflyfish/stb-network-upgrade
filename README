1.this code is update until 2011-12.
2.this is a system for  something special device upgrade from the network.as i say,
  the server sourcecode in "server" folder ,which is coding in C++, compile  in VC++6.0 IDE
  the client sourcecode in "stb_client" folder, you can use it for referance.

3.the folder "stb_client" is a modules in my company project source(dont worry,i own the copyright), which is used for network upgrading for the device 
may be you can't compile it correctly.so you can referance this code,and transplant to your own project,all is welcome!

4.the folder "server" you can  inbuild this project with  VC++6.0 IDE in windows OS(like xp/win7) , you can  directly open the VC pro file which is in sourcecode ,to build the demo.
